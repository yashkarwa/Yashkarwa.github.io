A notebook version of this post can be found [here](https://github.com/hadrienj/Preprocessing-for-deep-learning) on Github.

The goal of this post/notebook is to go from the basics of data preprocessing to modern techniques used in deep learning. My point is that we can use code (Python/Numpy etc.) to better understand abstract mathematical notions! Thinking by coding! ðŸ’¥
