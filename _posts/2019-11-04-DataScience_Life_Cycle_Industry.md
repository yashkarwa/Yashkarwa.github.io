Well, I don't want to go over another post on Data Science framework that you can find on the Internet by just googling it. I like the CRISP-DM life cycle and widely used and know in the industry. You can find the details [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining). However, I see a gap in educational content over the framework widely used in Industry.

Below are the steps of the newly adopted framework. In essence, it's an extension of CRISP-DM. It is the sequence of the phases and is not strict and moving back and forth between different stages as it is always required.

Below is the overview of DS framework:


1. Business Requirement

		- Define Objectives

		- Define outcomes (feedback)

2. Data Acquisition

		- Collect Data

		- Consult/work with/as Data Engineers

3. Data Preparation

		- Understand and Highlight problem areas, process, and caveats

4. Exploration of Data Analysis

		- Slice and Dice Data,

		- Plots Understand Data edge cases

5. Modelling , Evaluation & Interpretation

		- Develop the algorithm to solve a problem

		- Highlight different solution and recommendation

5. Communicate Results

		- Capture outcome after implementation

		- Consult with business stakeholders to share the result

6. Deployment strategy

		- Deployment (online / offline), API integration, Schedule..etc

		- Consult / work with Data Engineers /  Software Engineers for integration / Production

7. Testing framework

		- Measure Result by A/B testing

		- Consult/work with stakeholders to share the result

8. Business Approval

		- Showcase the **financial impact **

9. Operations

		- Create Standard Reporting framework to measure/track the performance of algorithms

		- Retrain models, handle failures, a process built

		- Consult/work with stakeholders to share the result

10. Optimization

		- Improve models

		- more data

		- more features code improvement

		- process improvement
