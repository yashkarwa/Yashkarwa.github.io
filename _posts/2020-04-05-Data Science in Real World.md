I see a couple of Challenges, I see in the courses vs. Real-time. The primary focus of the data science should be to provide the Business value. In addition to that, it should not only be just a notebook/ standalone script which cannot be reproducible or scalable. Think of building an end-to-end from data analysis to building a data Product.

### Next Steps

I will summarize the skills by providing links or quick materials  into primary ones:

- Data Analysis
- Machine Learning 
- Business Analysis

Also, the required skills set for real-world:

- Engineering -Software/ DevOps
- Data Engineering 
- Product Manager

Again as highlighted, you don't need to be an expert in each of the fields. You should be good enough to be productive. More to come...
