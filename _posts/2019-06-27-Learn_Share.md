The goal of the future post is to share knowledge, learn & share, simple & sweet!


1. **Future Post Context**: Primarly, I would focus on how would you take the Data Science + ML from Academia to Business settings in Solving a problem includes Technical, Business and Product Management.

2. **Academia & Industry Experience**: 10+ Years of Experience in Data Analytics.

3. **Why it is important for me?**: 
    A. Plethora of information not relevant to industry.
	B. Perfect blend of APPLIED DS / ML in business context.
	C. Bootcamps, offline / online course, apprentice program are really expensive, with little/no value add!
	D. Share, Learn and revist past learnings.

4. **How / What Blog will be shared?**: 
     A. Transition Business Problem to ML/DS Problem.
	 B. Define Value of solving problem in business context. Think of like a independent consultant!
	 C. Define end-to-end Lifecycle from data analytics, ML and optimization..
	 D. Show first cut model.
	 
5.  **New blog & content cadence**: 

     Every Week:
	 A  Business use-case 
	 B. Technical Explanation (DS Lifecycle + Deployment Application Integration (optional)) 
	 C. Showcase value and vision
