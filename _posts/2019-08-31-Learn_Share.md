The goal of the future post is to share knowledge, learn & share, simple & sweet!

As part of WEEKLY's - Business Case Solution, I will post solution (& past solution) from Data Exploration to final Product. Focus is to help aspirants to show DS/ML in real world.

**New Update**

Due to multiple requests - I have to prioritize different use-cases and focus only on the first-cut model

1. **Time spend by me:** < 10 hours/Week (Busy in office hours; please define your business problem clearly)
2. **Fees:** FREE
3. **Reach-out:** <a>yashkarwa.ms@gmail.com<\a>
4. **Data:** Proprietary data (code will not be shared on Github)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **Future Post Context**: Primarly, I would focus on how would you take the Data Science + ML from Academia to Business settings in Solving a problem includes Technical, Business and Product Management.

2. **Academia & Industry Experience**: 10+ Years of Experience in Data Analytics.

3. **Why it is important for me?**: 
    - Plethora of information not relevant to industry.
	- Perfect blend of APPLIED DS / ML in business context.
	- Bootcamps, offline / online course, apprentice program are really expensive, with little/no value add!
	- Share, Learn and revist past learnings.
	- Introduce DS concepts to Business stakeholders.
	

4. **How / What Blog will be shared?**: 
    - Transition Business Problem to ML/DS Problem.
	- Define Value of solving problem in business context. Think of like a independent consultant!
	- Define end-to-end Lifecycle from data analytics, ML and optimization..
	- Show first cut model. You can extend the model and solution.
	 
5.  **New blog & content cadence**: 

	 **Every Week**:
	-  Business use-case 
	- Technical Explanation (DS Lifecycle + Deployment Application Integration (optional)) 
	- Showcase value and vision of the business problem.
