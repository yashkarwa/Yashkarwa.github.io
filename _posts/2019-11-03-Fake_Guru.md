As job demands are increasing over-time, people are calling (or showcasing) them as AI/ML Guru.

It's okay with individuals calling themselves or believing in them as an expert in the field (**#fakeguru**) and projecting them as academia or Industry expert. However, it's terrible when the same people are selling courses, books, and services that are free on the internet, mainly blogs and GitHub. 

Don't get me wrong - I have liked contents, courses, and books that solve the business problem or explain the concepts in detail. I hate the same individual who doesn't have grips on basics (just applying the 'fit' method, and it will solve ALL the problem).

Just beware of this #fakeguru; Don't get influenced. I have been there and done that!

I will recommend free online auditable courses  (not in any order):
- fast.ai (highly recommended)
- Coursera
- edX
- Udemy
- Udacity (prices are much higher now, I will look for specialized one)

Don't go for courses/mentor, who don't have *REAL* experience (not by social media followers) and finding an individual with real experience is tough and expensive :)
