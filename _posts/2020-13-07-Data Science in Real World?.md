### Next Steps

I will summarize the skills by providing links or quick materials  into primary ones:

- Data Analysis
- Machine Learning 
- Business Analysis

Also, the required skills set for real-world:

- Engineering -Software/ DevOps
- Data Engineering 
- Product Manager

Again as highlighted, you don't need to be an expert in each of the fields. You should be good enough to be productive. More to come...
