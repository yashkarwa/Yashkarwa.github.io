I see a couple of Challenges I see in the courses and Real-time. The primary focus of the data science should be to provide the Business value. In addition to that, it should not only be just a notebook/ standalone script which cannot be reproducible or scalable. Think of building an end-to-end from data analysis to building a data Product.
